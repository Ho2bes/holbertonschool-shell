# Holberton School - I/O Redirections and Filters

Welcome to the **I/O Redirections and Filters** project! In this project, you'll learn how to manage input and output redirections in the shell and how to use various filters to process and manipulate data streams. Understanding these concepts is essential for efficient shell scripting and command-line operations.

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Redirect **standard input (stdin)**, **standard output (stdout)**, and **standard error (stderr)**.
- Use various **redirection operators** like `>`, `>>`, `<`, `2>`, and `&>`.
- Combine commands with **pipes (`|`)** to process data through filters.
- Use common filters like `grep`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `sed`, and `awk` to manipulate and process data streams.
- Redirect output to files or other commands for further processing.
